The frontend of this application is made in `Next.js` and `Sass` for styling, the color palette was inspired by the Omni Theme theme
from vscode, for in the project home you can see all the modules existing in the database, see the number of classes and minutes in each module that, when clicked, the user is redirected to the module page where all classes are listed, and if you were the one who created the module, a button written `new class` will appear where you can create new classes behind a modal. To create modules and classes you will first have to click on `login with github` and allow the application to retrieve your email, name and profile data, after login a button will appear next to the page title written `new module` that when clicked, a modal opens asking if you want to login administratively to create modules and classes, after clicking `yes` if you want, click again on the button and create the module.
